# Extract Rectangle
A handy tool extracts a rectangle region in the scene (a quadrilateral in the image) and correct perspective projection distortion back to a rectangle.  Users can assign the specific size of the output image (i.g., usual paper sizes like A4 or manually assign width and height)

# Functions
1. Four-point perspective transformation
2. Change image size (aspect ratio)
3. Upsampling or downsampling image
4. Manual select white region to correct White Balance of the image (optional)
4. Support four image types for output (BMP, PNG, TIF, JPG)

# Features
1. Automatic maximize image figure to fit the screen size and prevent overlapping with original UI windows.
2. Auto selects output image aspect ratio by the outcome eigenvalues after orthogonalization.

# Using Scenario
1. Scan a paper by photography
2. Actions demands to four-point perspective transformation on the image
3. Quick crop specific region in the image and perform white balance correction
